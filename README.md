# Crown Clothing, Ltd.

A basic clothing store built using React, Firebase database, and Stripe API. 
This store allows a user to create an account from scratch, or use Google to
create an account and be able to sign in. The store also allows users to 
act as if they are purchasing goods by selecting from what items are available
to a persistent cart and provides users with demo credit card information 
so as to complete the checkout process.
